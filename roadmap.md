Timer Roadmap
===

Things being worked on:

- Custom keyboard bindings ( redefine the keys used to suit your own operational style )
- keyboard help page (displays the currently assigned keys)
- API (start/update the timer remotely, or display countdown data simultaneously on multple devices)
- streamdeck integration (will use API)
- schedule editor (use API to cue up a list of events that will be timed in sequence)
- temporary timer overlay (time an event within an event, then resume the original event)
- audio trigger (start the timer on first audio above a threshold, using your devices microphone or line input)
- video playback timer (uses audio trigger and temporary timer overlay to start timer on first audio from a video. resumes previous countdown afterwards. use to give a presenter a video countdown in the middle of their overall presentation)
